We built a small schema in mysql and enabled a graphql interface for it. The
intention was to collect additional preference data, allowing the user to
reject our activity suggestion, and specify why. We would then have asked the
user whether these reasons apply to other activities and create a basic expert
system out of the resulting data. Getting the graphql to work took up all of
our time, and we didn't get to use it. The interface is in mysqlinterface.py.

Put 1.glade and main.py in the same folder and run main.py from the command
line: python main.py
